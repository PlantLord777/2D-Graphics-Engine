# Plant 2D Game Engine

This is a grid based graphics engine. The graphic display capablilities are written in C++ which is compiled into a dll for use by the game logic code which is written in C#.
An example of a game implemented with this can be seen on the Snake branch of this repository.

How to Run:
1. Download VSStudio 2022 with c++ compatablity and .NET (C#)
2. Clone the ratworld repository
3. Let cmake compile (should be automatic)
4. IMPORTANT right click CMakeLists.txt and build otherwise ratgraphics.dll will not be generated
5. switch to running ratworld.exe
6. Run

The main file is main.cs and is in c#
the graphics file is graphics.cpp and is in c++

If you make changes push them to a seperate branch
